# Notes
My personal notes on programming, distributed systems, scalability, and other topics.

## Algorithms
 * The Raft Consensus Algorithm

## Data Analysis

 * Folium makes it easy to visualize data that's been manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet map. It enables both the binding of    data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing Vincent/Vega visualizations as markers on the map.
